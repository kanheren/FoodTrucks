Concept Covered:
1) MVP Archtechture: A minimum of 80% of the code should be automatically tested when using a Model View Presenter with layered design to isolate each layer with dependency injunction to test it:

2) Using protocol-oriented programming, we can create automation tests that can run/execute at the test level, staging level, and production level by using an environment object for the dependency injection.
   
3) Each layer is isolated and tested using Stub and Mock.
   
4) XC unit test
   
5) XC UI test
   
6) Pattern used:
	•	Builder Pattern - building http request object
	•	Strategy Pattern - API/CXS network strategy 
	•	Singleton Pattern
	•	Component Pattern
